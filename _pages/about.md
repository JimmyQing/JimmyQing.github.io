# üßë‚Äç About Me

I‚Äôm currently an associate professor at [School of Electronics and Communication Engineering](https://sece.sysu.edu.cn/), [Sun Yat-Sen University](https://www.sysu.edu.cn/). Before joining Sun Yat-Sen University, I was an associate research fellow at [Shenzhen Institute of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics for Society](https://airs.cuhk.edu.cn/), [The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen](https://www.cuhk.edu.cn/zh-hans). 

I obtained my Ph.D. from [State Key Laboratory of Robotics, Shenyang Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences](http://www.sia.cas.cn/) in 2020/01. My Ph.D. supervisors are [Prof. Yangmin Li](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/ise/people/academic-staff/y-m-li/) and [Prof. Jinguo Liu](https://people.ucas.edu.cn/~jgliu). I was a visitor of [Prof. Zhaojie Ju](https://www.port.ac.uk/about-us/structure-and-governance/our-people/our-staff/zhaojie-ju)‚Äôs group at [the University of Portsmouth](https://www.port.ac.uk/), U.K. in 2018/02-2019/02. 

My research interest includes: 
- Machine vision
- Pattern recognition
- Human-robot interaction
- Deep learning
- Multimodal perception
- Action recognition

My research is dedicated to realizing the intelligent perception, understanding and interaction of robots with multimodal human behavior (such as body action, hand gesture, face expression, and gaze orientation).
