# üßë‚Äç About Me

I‚Äôm currently an associate professor at [School of Electronics and Communication Engineering](https://sece.sysu.edu.cn/), [Sun Yat-Sen University](https://www.sysu.edu.cn/). Before joining Sun Yat-Sen University, I was an associate research fellow at [Shenzhen Institute of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics for Society](https://airs.cuhk.edu.cn/), [The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen](https://www.cuhk.edu.cn/zh-hans). 

I obtained my Ph.D. from [State Key Laboratory of Robotics, Shenyang Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences](http://www.sia.cas.cn/) in 2020/01. My Ph.D. supervisors are [Prof. Yangmin Li](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/ise/people/academic-staff/y-m-li/) and [Prof. Jinguo Liu](https://people.ucas.edu.cn/~jgliu). I was a visitor of [Prof. Zhaojie Ju](https://www.port.ac.uk/about-us/structure-and-governance/our-people/our-staff/zhaojie-ju)‚Äôs group at [the University of Portsmouth](https://www.port.ac.uk/), U.K. in 2018/02-2019/02. 

My research interests include: 
- **Machine Vision**: Human Parts Detection, Body Pose Estimation, Action Recognition, Multimodal Perception
- **Machine Learning**: Deep Learning, Pattern Recognition
- **Robotics**: Human-Robot Interaction, Bionic Robot Teleoperation, Skill Transfer

My research is dedicated to realizing the intelligent perception, cognition, and interaction of robots to multimodal human behaviors (such as body action, hand gesture, face expression, and gaze orientation).
